Veggie Burger: A veggie burger is a burger patty that does not contain meat. In India where vegetarianism is widespread, McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's and KFC serve veggie burgers. In 2012, McDonald's opened its first vegetarian-only restaurant in India. Most of the veggie burgers are good for our health as the vegetables and the other ingredients are rich in vitamins and minerals. The first burger was made in United States in 1900 by Louis Lassen, a Danish immigrant, owner of Louis' Lunch in New Haven.
