Veggie Burger: A veggie burger is a burger patty that does not contain meat. In India where vegetarianism is widespread, McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's and KFC serve veggie burgers. In 2012, McDonald's opened its first vegetarian-only restaurant in India. Most of the veggie burgers are good for our health as the vegetables and the other ingredients are rich in vitamins and minerals. The first burger was made in United States in 1900 by Louis Lassen, a Danish immigrant, owner of Louis' Lunch in New Haven.

Ingredients: The ingredients in a simple veg burger are vegetable patty, cheese, lettuce, mayo and pickles in a sesame seed bun. The vegetable patty has no meat ingredients in it .It is made of potatoes, peas, corn, carrot and onion. Some dry ingredients, such as oats, flours, nuts, or breadcrumbs, can be used to absorb excess moisture and liquid, which results in the patty sticking together tightly. 

Recipe: First, toast the bun. Then, apply a special sauce which is a mixture of chilli sauce, tomato sauce, Mayonnaise and pepper. Next, place slightly chopped lettuce, tomato and onion. Then, place the veg patty and some butter and cheese on top of it. We can apply some more ketchup if we want to make it tasty. Now, serve this yummy veg burger with tomato ketchup. To make our burger tastier, we can even add some more vegetables.
