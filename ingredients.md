Ingredients: The ingredients in a simple veg burger are vegetable patty, cheese, lettuce, mayo and pickles in a sesame seed bun. The vegetable patty has no meat ingredients in it .It is made of potatoes, peas, corn, carrot and onion. Some dry ingredients, such as oats, flours, nuts, or breadcrumbs, can be used to absorb excess moisture and liquid, which results in the patty sticking together tightly.
